Procedure for adding grippers

This version of the HCT-1200 plug-in is compatible with the following grippers:

- Schunk Co-Act
- Robotiq E-Hand
- Robotiq 2F-85/140
- Robotiq AirPick
- OnRobot RG-6
- Any gripper which is controlled through the IO board 

To add a gripper to the plug in you can following the following steps:

In the extension node HTML code:

	- Add a page that where the settings of the gripper can be entered. You can take f.i. 'inputScreenGripperC' as a template

In the extension node contribution:

	- Add the screen, that you added to the HTML file, to the screen list in the constructor function. (around line 58)
	- Add the components in you HTML page to the select and input boxes (around line 78)
	- Add the grippers name to 'this.selGripperList' in the constructor function.
	- Add the screen, that you added to the HTML file, to the switchScreen function.
	- Add the gripper to the setGripperPageTwo function to make sure the right screen will appear when the gripper settings are entered.
	- Add the gripper to the saveGripperSettings function.

	If you added a Robotiq or OnRobot gripper:
	- look for the if statement in the setGripperPageOne function that checks if the plug-in is installed and add your gripper to
	  this list so it will get deleted when the Robotiq plug-in is not installed. Do this by adding the following command:
	   this.selGripperBrand.removeItem("Your gripper name");

In the program node contribution:

	- Add the logic needed to open and close the gripper to the generateScript function (around line 271)

	If you added a Robotiq or gripper:
	- Add the name of your Robotiq gripper to the if statement in the generateScript function around line 150 that gets the gripper ID.
